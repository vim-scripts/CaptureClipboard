DESCRIPTION
Quotes or text fragments can be collected from various sources outside Vim
into a single text document through the clipboard. This plugin makes
consecutive copy-and-pastes into Vim much more comfortable by monitoring the
system clipboard for changes and appending them into the current Vim buffer
automatically. Feedback about the number of captures is given in Vim's window
title, so one does not have to switch back and forth between applications any
more, and can completely focus on text collection via CTRL-C, CTRL-C, ...

USAGE
:[count]CaptureClipboard[!] {delimiter}
:[count]CaptureClipboard[!] {prefix}^M{suffix}
:[count]CaptureClipboard[!] {prefix}^M{delimiter}^M{suffix}
:[count]CaptureClipboard[!] {first-prefix}^M{prefix}^M{delimiter}^M{suffix}
:[count]CaptureClipboardReverse[!] {...}
                        Monitors the clipboard for changes and inserts any
                        change of clipboard contents into the current buffer
                        (in new lines, or, if given, delimited by {delimiter},
                        and with {prefix} before and {suffix} after).
                        To stop, press <CTRL-C> or copy a literal dot (".") to
                        the clipboard. If [count] is given, the capture stops
                        after [count] captures.

                        If [!] is given, whitespace (including new lines) is
                        trimmed from the beginning and end of each capture.

                        With :CaptureClipboardReverse, changes are prepended,
                        reverting the insertion order. Normally, changes are
                        appended to the current or given [line].
                        Use :$|CaptureClipboard to append to the end of the
                        current buffer.

                        {delimiter} is evaluated as an expression if it is
                        (single- or double-) quoted, or contains backslashes.
                        The default {delimiter} is "\n"; each capture is
                        placed on a new line. Use '' to place everything next
                        to each other, ' ' to put a space character in
                        between, "\n--\n" to insert a -- separator line
                        between captures. When {delimiter} contains a newline
                        character, the first capture will already start on a
                        new line.
                        Backslash-escaped characters (like \n) are also
                        supported in {prefix} and {suffix}.

CTRL-R ?                Wait for one capture from the clipboard and insert it
                        at the current cursor position.
